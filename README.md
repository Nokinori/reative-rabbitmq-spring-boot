# Reactive RabbitMQ Spring Boot Starter

This is spring boot starter for [Reactor RabbitMQ](https://projectreactor.io/docs/rabbitmq/release/reference/) library.

The main ideas:
- reduce the complexity of working with Reactor RabbitMQ
- provide useful methods to produce and consume messages
- provide analogues to annotation like `@RabbitListener`
- stay in the way of using functional APIs with non-blocking style
